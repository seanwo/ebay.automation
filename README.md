# eBay Diecast Automation

This repository automates the end-to-end process of creating eBay listings for diecast collectibles, including pricing based on rarity and sales data, generating formatted HTML descriptions from a template, uploading and retrieving product images via AWS S3, and producing EPS-compatible bulk upload files using account-specific configuration.
